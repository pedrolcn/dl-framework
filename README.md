# SergueiFlow

This is an attempt to build my very own deep learning framework, which has been hereby named SergueiFlow
as it is heavily influenced by TensorFlow

A deep learning framework consists of the following features:

	1) A tensor object [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED]
	2) Operations on this tensor object [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED]
	3) A computational graph object [UNDERWAY]
	4) Optimizers [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED]

and much more.

Please bear in mind that this is being done not out of some practical or even sane concern, it is basically and utterly
just for funsies

So far nothing is done, but the implementation of the computational graph object is underway, along with it's
interfaces and some unit tests

I decided to start with the comp graph object since it would most likely be the most complex since the tensor object and
operations shouldn't stray too far from pretty vanilla NumPy
